# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

In this project our purpose was to refactor the VBA code we initally wrote up for Steve in order to analyze details of specific stocks. My job was to determin if refactoring the code made the VBA script run faster.  

## Results

My refactored code details can be found in the VBA_Challenge.xlsm file under module 2 of the VBA Basic editor. 

The stock performance with the 11 selected companies for 2017 was much better than the performance of 2018. It would be ill advised for Steve's parents to invest in either of those companies. Especially, "DQ" which his parents were most interested in since it dropped 63% from 2017 to 2018 and had the largest drop out of all the tickers. 

In the images below you can see the difference's in execution times from before and after the refactoring of the script. It doesn't appear that refactoring helped from the inital code.

## Summary

###### 1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

I felt refactoring the code put me at a disadvantage. I encountered a lot of errors and struggled to figure out why my code wasn't working properly. It was definitly much more time consumeing for me. 

###### 2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

The only pro that I felt I had is that a lot of the code details were already written out from our inital project so I could easily copy and paste the old details into the refactored code and only have to make a few updates here and there.
